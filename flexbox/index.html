      <p>
        Color codes are ways of representing the colors we see everyday in a
        format that a computer can interpret and display. Commonly used in
        websites and other software applications, there are a variety of
        formats, including Hex color codes, RGB and HSL values, and HTML color
        names, amongst others.
      </p>
      <h2>RGB COLOR CODES</h2>
      <p>
        Red Green Blue (RGB) is a color model that represents colors as mixtures
        of three underlying components (or channels), namely, red, green, and
        blue. Each color is described by a sequence of three numbers (typically
        between 0.0 and 1.0, or between 0 and 255) that represent the different
        intensities (or contributions) of red, green, and blue, in determining
        the final color.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to
        its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0. rgb(0, 0, 0) is
        displayed as black, all color parameters must be set to 0. rgb(255, 255,
        255) is displayed as white, all color parameters must be set to 255
      </p>
      <h2>HEX COLOR CODES</h2>
      <p>
        Hex color codes are represented by three byte hexadecimal numbers
        (meaning they consist of six digits), with each byte, or pair of
        characters in the Hex code, representing the intensity of red, green and
        blue in the color respectively
      </p>

      <p>
        Hex code byte values range from 00, which is the lowest intensity of a
        color, to FF which represents the highest intensity. The color white,
        for example, is made by mixing each of the three primary colors at their
        full intensity, resulting in the Hex color code of #FFFFFF.
      </p>

      <p>
        Black, the absence of any color on a screen display, is the complete
        opposite, with each color displayed at their lowest possible intensity
        and a Hex color code of #000000.
      </p>

      <p>
        The three primary colors, red, green and blue, are made by mixing the
        highest intensity of the desired color with the lowest intensities of
        the other two: #FF0000 - red, #00FF00 - green, #0000FF - blue.
      </p>

      <p>
        With modern browsers supporting the full spectrum of 24-bit color, there
        are 16,777,216 different color possibilities. Use our color picker to
        explore all 16.7 million of them, or if thatâ€™s too many, check out our
        color charts for a selection of palettes focused on flat design,
        Material design and web safe colors.
